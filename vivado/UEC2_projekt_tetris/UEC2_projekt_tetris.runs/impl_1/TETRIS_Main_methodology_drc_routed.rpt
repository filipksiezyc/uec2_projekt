2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
SYNTH-6#1 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance char_gen/char_code_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#2 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance char_gen_move/char_code_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>

SYNTH-6#3 Warning
Timing of a block RAM might be sub-optimal  
The timing for the instance font_gen/char_line_pixels_reg, implemented as a block RAM, might be sub-optimal as no output register was merged into the block
Related violations: <none>
