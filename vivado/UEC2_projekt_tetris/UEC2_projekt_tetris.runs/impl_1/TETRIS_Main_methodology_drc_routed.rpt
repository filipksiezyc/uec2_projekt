2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.066 ns between Keyboard_Receiver/keycode_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk50MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER) and tetris_logic/keycode_used_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk65MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.075 ns between Keyboard_Receiver/keycode_reg[5]/C (clocked by clk50MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER) and tetris_logic/keycode_used_reg[5]/D (clocked by clk65MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#3 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.097 ns between Keyboard_Receiver/keycode_reg[4]/C (clocked by clk50MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER) and tetris_logic/keycode_used_reg[4]/D (clocked by clk65MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#4 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.509 ns between random_blocks/rand_count_reg[0]/C (clocked by clk_rand_IP_CLK_DIVIDER) and tetris_logic/blk_code_reg[0]/D (clocked by clk65MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#5 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.673 ns between random_blocks/rand_count_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_rand_IP_CLK_DIVIDER) and tetris_logic/blk_code_reg[1]/D (clocked by clk65MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#6 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.725 ns between random_blocks/rand_count_reg[1]/C (clocked by clk_rand_IP_CLK_DIVIDER) and tetris_logic/blk_code_reg[2]/D (clocked by clk65MHz_IP_CLK_DIVIDER). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
